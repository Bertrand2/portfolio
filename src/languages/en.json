            "I'm Bertrand, a 24 years old guy from Belgium curious about the world who likes to learn and help others. I started programming because I felt it could be a game-changer in the educational system, but it is still not well-used. My main focuses are a greener, more accessible, open source, privacy-oriented web and better ways to learn.",
